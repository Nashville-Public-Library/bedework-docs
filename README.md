# Bedework Guide made with MkDocs and Material for MkDocs

The Bedework guide is made with MkDocs and Material for MkDocs. Documentation is written in markdown. All markdown files are saved in the /docs directory. Images are saved in the /img folder inside /docs. [See Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) 

There's an excellent overview video on installing and setting up MkDocs and Material for MkDocs, in general, on YouTube: [How To Create STUNNING Code Documentation With MkDocs Material Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-YA_dA8C20).
