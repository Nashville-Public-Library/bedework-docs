# Collection Page

Use the Collection content type to add a special collection to the website.

This isn’t generally used for things like Curriculum Kits, but rather for things like Civil Rights Collection and other major, archival collections.

## Add a Collection

1. Title: Enter the title for the collection in the Collection field.
   1. Text entered here will show up in the tab you see in your browser.
   1. Text here will also appear in the Banner, unless a logo is added. If a logo is added, the logo image will appear in the banner instead of the page title.
1. Hero: Add a Hero for the top of the page. The hero image should be related to the collection. You can use a single image or a collage of smaller images.
