# Description

Entries that do not meet these criteria will be revised or returned for editing. Whenever possible, use descriptions from past calendar entries.

## Order of Details

1. Recurrence pattern
1. Brief description
1. Age (or school grade) range of intended audience (required for all Children and Teen events)
1. Registration information, if needed

## Writing Style

Describe what to expect at program – set user expectations about the event. Begin descriptions with what the guest will do and/or discuss. Avoid long passages of names or credentials—a single sentence is sufficient. Use short sentences that convey one idea apiece.

Focus on a call to action/invitation.

    - YES: Come make a pine cone birdhouse with us, then take it home with you.
    - NO: Participants will learn to make a birdhouse out of pinecones. Participants will take their birdhouses home with them.

Use appropriate calls to action (CTAs), and vary them appropriately.  Don’t use “Join us...” for everything.

    - Visit, Don’t miss, Drop by, Come see, Learn, Make

Use present tense in descriptions, not future tense. Present tense is appropriate in the online events calendar contexts.  

    - YES: We dance, play, and sing.
    - NO: We will dance, play and sing.

    - YES: Jane Doe presents
    - NO: Jane Doe will present

Use active voice; avoid passive voice whenever possible.

    - YES: Tori demonstrates how to make a kite.
    - NO: Kite making is explained by Tori.

    - YES: Our guest speaker discusses the history of music in Nashville.
    - NO: The history of music in Nashville is discussed by our guest.

Use good keywords. Name items to be discussed. All book sales should have the words "book sale" in the description.

    - eBooks
    - Microsoft Word
    - Gardening

Don't include event times in the description field.  
Don’t use special characters in titles. ``(& ` ~ @)``

Refer to the [NPL Style Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GEg7vq-WWuBhZaVDM39cERYrDljqLXI5CUQngT1d694/edit?usp=sharing) for writing style rules governing all library communications.

## Required Content

### Recurrence Pattern

1. Select `event recurs` to bring up the recurrence menu.

- Use 3 letter abbreviation for months: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
- Use entire word for days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.
- Do not use a period at the end of the field.
- Cross-reference events that have multiple times/dates.
  - List “Citizenship Class with Nashville Adult Literacy Council, Every Monday and Tuesday, 10:00 AM-12:30 PM, and 5:45 PM-7:30 PM” in the recurrence pattern field for citizenship classes that happen on multiple dates and times.  
- Only include times in the Recurrence Patterns text field if the same event occurs at multiple times on the same day.
  - List “Every Tuesday at 9:30 AM, 10:30 AM, 11:30 AM” in the recurrence pattern field for story times that have multiple showings per day.

#### Listing Exceptions

- ONLY list exception dates if there is no “replacement” event occurring on the same day and time as the regular program, for the same age group.
  - List “Every Tuesday except Sep 5” for Preschool Story Time if there will be no story time, featured guest, or other event for preschool children to attend on that day and time.
