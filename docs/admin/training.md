SUBJECT: Please Begin Adding Events for Next Quarter to Library Calendar (Bedework)

Please add all confirmed events for the {Fall quarter, SEP-OCT-NOV, 2023}. There is no deadline, no print publication. Please add within the three month increments (Dec Jan Feb / Mar Apr May / Jun Jul Aug / Sep Oct Nov). Do not add events scheduled more than nine months ahead.

It is best to add regular recurring programs as early as possible. We use this process to confirm whether event series are continuing into the next quarter. This allows Marketing-Communications adequate notice for publicity. Do not list any events on social media or public communications before they are added to the events calendar.
