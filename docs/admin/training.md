Hi Event Programmers,

Please add all confirmed events for the Summer (JUN-JUL-AUG), fall (SEP-OCT-NOV) quarters, and begin adding winter 2025 (DEC-JAN-FEB) events.

Add regular recurring programs as early as possible. We use this process to confirm whether events series are continuing into the next quarter, or have been discontinued. This also allows MarCom adequate notice for publicity.

Please add images from the image library to recurring events and guests. Most series and partners have logos here. Let me know if you would like one added.
