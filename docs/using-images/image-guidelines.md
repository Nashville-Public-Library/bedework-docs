# Image Guidelines

If there is an existing graphic / logo (story time, studio, etc.), use the established image as the thumbnail image in Bedework. Please don’t create a new image.

Use the _Image Library_ by going to <u>[Click here to choose from the library of images](https://nashville-public-library.github.io/bedework-docs/image-library/series-logos/)</u>. Use the copy graphic to copy the image URL path. Use your keyboard shortcuts to paste (CTRL+V) the path in the table into the Image URL and Thumbnail URL fields. The URL paths links will begin `/public/img/`. If there is not an existing graphic, you may create an image for the thumbnail graphic in Bedework.

- Calendar approvers will review the image.
- Images submitted with events may be removed, remade, or replaced, at the approver’s discretion.
- Accepted images will be added to the Images Library accessible from the Bedework entry form for re-use next quarter.

## Size and Text Specifications

- Max width: 400px
- Max height: 600px
- File size: Less than 100 KB
- Thumbnail is automatically created when you upload an image. You may also create a separate thumbnail image. If you want to use a separate thumbnail image, email the images to Web Services and we’ll add them for you.
- Do not leave white space around the image. White space is added automatically by the calendar stylesheet.
- Words in icon-type images (“Movie Friday” or “Chocolate Worms”) should be readable at thumbnail-size, which is 80px wide.

- Hit the resize button at the top

![img "resize image"](../img/paint-resize.jpg)

- Click the button for "Pixels." Check "Maintain aspect ratio." Type what size you want the image to be, and click “OK.”
