# What to Write

The NPL blog is a space for you to talk about library collections and initiatives. Posts should always recommend or highlight something NPL has, or does, for the public.

We never censor the materials in our collection, nor do we limit which NPL materials you may write about in a blog post. However, in the interest of brand and reputation protection, you must limit editorializing, especially as regards defamation and controversial topics.

- DO give your opinion on a Jimmy Carter biography.
- DO NOT give your personal opinion on whether or not he handled the Iran Hostage Crisis properly.
- DO talk about materials in our collection about mass transit, and information about the pros and cons of it contained therein.
- DO NOT make a case for whether Nashville needs a light rail system or not.

Make sure your writing never infringes copyright or trademarks, and avoid libel (written defamation).

Be sensitive and respectful always, and keep your writing "PG rated."

When in doubt, email the MarCom team or ask your manager to review any content you're unsure of.

If you schedule a post to publish, it is an implicit statement that either your manager has reviewed that post and approves, or that they have granted you autonomy to "fly solo"â€”i.e., they're comfortable with you publishing your content without their prior review.
