# Example Book/Movie/Music Review

A review generally has several paragraphs of text that highlight a single title. A review must include a catalog promo. It can also include images and additional recommendations.

In this example, we’re reviewing a book called *Nashville Food Trucks*. The content comes from [Amanda’s Savor Summer blog post](https://library.nashville.org/blog/2015/07/savor-summer-nashville-food-trucks).

Our post will include the following 3 components:
- Text: Headings and body text
- Media: Image at the top of the post
- Catalog Promos: Promo at the top of the post for the item that is being reviewed. Additional promos a the end of the post in the You Might Also Like section.

## Create New Blog Post

We’ll start by creating a blog post and adding our main content.
1. Log in to Drupal with your username and password.
1. In the menu bar, select Content > Add Content > Blog Entry.
1. Add a Title. Choose an engaging title that tells the reader what the post is about.
1. Add a Posted Date for your post. This should be the same date you use for scheduling your post.
1. Add Blog Author. Type a first or last name in the author box. Then select the correct name from the list.
1. In the Content tab, click Add Text.
   1. Leave Display Mode set to default. Paste your first section of text from your draft. I pasted in all the text that appears before the image in my blog post.
1. In the Content tab, click Add Media.
   1. Leave Display Mode set to default.
   1. Click Select Media to upload your image.
   1. Click the Add Image link at the top. Then choose the file to upload.
   1. Add alt text to describe your image. Then save.
1. In the Content tab, click Add Text. I’m adding the text that comes after the image, but before the catalog promo. I’m stacking LEGOs on top of one another.
   1. Paste in your next section of text from your draft blog post.
1. Use the component dropdown to select a Catalog Promo.
   1. Fill out the form to add the book Title, Record ID, and Author.
1. At this point, you may decide you want the image at the top of your post. No problem. Click the “Collapse All” button.
   1. Then use the plus sign to rearrange the components.

## Add Titles to You Might Also Like

This post has a series of recommendations at the end of the blog post. These are titles that are related to the title that is being reviewed.

1. Click the You Might Also Like Tab.
1. Then click the Add Catalog Promo button.
1. Fill out the Title, Record ID, and Author fields.
1. Add another catalog promo by clicking the Add Catalog Promo button.
1. Repeat until you’ve added all of your related titles.

## Tag Your Post

Every blog post must include at least one tag, though you probably want to use more.

1. Click the Tagging Tab.
1. Click in the Section box. Select at least one top-level section. Top-level section tags do NOT have a dash to the left side of the tag. Tags with the dash are children of the top-level tags. You can choose multiple section tags.

## Add a Thumbnail and Summary

Every blog post must include a thumbnail image and summary.

1. Click the Summary tab.
1. Click Select Image. Then click Add Image to upload your thumbnail image.
1. Type a brief summary of your post in the Summary field. The summary should be a 1-2 sentence overview of what the post covers. You can make words italicized or bold, but please avoid block quotes, links, images, and lists in the summary.

## Schedule Your Post to Publish

Blog posts are not published when you save them. We do this on purpose so you never accidentally publish a blog post. When you’re ready to publish, do NOT use the checkbox unless you want your post to publish immediately.

1. To schedule your post to publish at a certain date and time, use the Scheduling Options box on the right side of the screen. If the box is collapsed, click the title to expand.
1. Type a date and time for your post to publish. This date must match the date in the Posted Date field under the post title.
1. Click Save. Your post will publish within three hours of the time specified.
