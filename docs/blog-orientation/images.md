# Images

## Blog Image Size Requirements

Always start with high-quality pictures. You should only ever size images down. Don’t take a small image and enlarge it because it will appear blurry or pixelated.

### Thumbnail Image

If you upload an image larger than 450x450, the image will automatically be scaled down and cropped to 450x450. Cropping happens at the edges so that the center of an image is preserved.

If you want to control how the thumbnail image looks, create a 450x450 image and it will be shown without scaling or cropping.

Image size requirements:

- Width: 450px
- Height: 450px
- Allowed file types: png gif jpg jpeg
- Max file size: 50 MB
- Resolution: 72 dpi

### Images in Blog Post Content

Images should fill the width of the page or come close. Do not wrap text around images. This results in a full-width image and ensures that posts will look their best on any device or screen size.

Image size requirements:

- Width: 600px to 800px
- Height: not prescribed
- Allowed file types: png gif jpg jpeg
- Max file size: 50 MB
- Resolution: 72 dpi

## Find an Image for a Post

### Find a Book Cover Image

Find the largest cover image you can so you can size the image down. For the blog, look for images that are at least 450px wide.

Find large images in Google. Marketing and Communications follows this rule of thumb: look for a larger version of whatever cover image displays on the catalog entry for the item, since we pay to use those catalog images.
1. Go to Google.com and search for the book cover. For example, type “Glennon Doyle book cover” to look for Doyle’s book covers.
1. Click Images to view only image results.
1. Under Tools (right under the search bar), select Size and choose Large or Medium.
1. When you mouse over an image, you’ll see the image size in the lower left corner (circled in red below so you can see it).
1. Save the image to your desktop.
1. Resize if needed, then upload the image to the blog.
