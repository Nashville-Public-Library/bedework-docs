# Plan Your Post

We recommend planning your post and gathering all necessary assets before creating a new post on the website. This ensures you can focus on writing when you're writing and not worry about losing any work.

## Draft Your Post in a Text Editor

Before adding a post to the website, write a draft of your post in a plain text editor, like Notepad. This helps you plan where you’ll have headings, images, etc. We recommend Notepad because it strips out all the formatting and won’t add extra markup to your blog post. Please do not use Word or Google Docs.

## Find and Resize Images

Find a picture to use as your thumbnail image. The thumbnail image will be displayed on the blog landing page where all blog posts are listed together. Thumbnail images should be good-quality and related to the post. Find the largest image you can so you can size it down and not lose picture quality.

If you’re using images in the body of your post, spend some time looking for good-quality images that are over 500px wide.

Resize your images before you start adding your post to the blog. See the [Images section](/docs/blog-orientation/images/) for image size requirements.

Remember! MarCom can provide stock images with clear usage rights. 

## Gather Catalog Links

If you're using a catalog promo, get all the Grouped Work IDs to make catalog promo creation faster.

If you're using a catalog widget or list, go ahead and create the list and get the list or widget URL.
