## Entry Form Tour

The blog form has a lot of parts. Key items are marked required. Review the elements below to familiarize yourself with how the blog form works.

- Title: Type the title of the post. See the [Writing for the Web](/writing-for-the-web/writing-for-web/) section for tips on good titles.
- Posted Date: This date will display to the user as the yellow date on the blog list and the blog entry.
- Blog Author: Select the blog author by typing first or last name. This will pull in the correct author block at the end of the post.
- Content: Add text, media (images, video, etc.), catalog promos, catalog widgets, and other content. You can use each component multiple times in any order.
- You Might Also Like: Optional. Add a list of recommendations to the end of the post.
- Tagging: You must tag your post so it can appear in the right places on the website. You canâ€™t save your post, even as a draft, without tagging it first.  
      - Tagging > Sections: You MUST add one top-level category from the Sections drop down. You can add more than one section, but please don't add all of them.

      - Tagging > Sections: Do not select a Child tag without also selecting the Parent Child tags (major category and subcategories). For example, if you want to tag a post with "chapter books" (subcategory) you must also select "children" (the major section category).

- Summary: Add the thumbnail image and summary text that will be used when posts are shown in list, like on the blog landing page.
- Scheduling: Schedule your post to publish in the future. Date must match the info in the Posted Date field. Remember to add your date and topic to the [blog schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BrXbgkQERFoHPWHxh_2PhvHrKDJbXR4-aLyqae6mO6M/edit?usp=sharing).

## Adding a Component

Use the dropdown to select a component to add to your blog post. If you want to write a paragraph, add the text component. If you want to add a catalog promo, select the catalog promo component. You can use each component as many times as you like in any order.

## Text Editing Tools  

The text component, and any block where you add long-form text, will have a toolbar at the top of the box where you type. Most icons will look similar to what you find in Word or Google Docs. The unique buttons are outlined below.

- Format: Use the format dropdown to markup text as Normal Text, Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3, etc.
- Styles: Use the styles dropdown to add a predefined style to text or a link. Links that are calls to action can be styled as primary or secondary buttons. Text at the top of a blog post can be styled as intro text to make it larger.
- Block Quote: The large quote marks allow you to make a block of text into a block quote.
- Media: The large E allows you to add media to a text block. This is useful if you'd like an image to have a caption or you need an image to always be under a specific paragraph.
- Special Characters: Use the omega button to add a special character to your text.
