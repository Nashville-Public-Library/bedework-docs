We're excited you'd like to share your interests and expertise with library patrons!

This blog orientation will show you how to start a blog post, how to use the editing tools, and where to find step-by-step instructions for adding content. The orientation will also cover three different types of posts so you can see how they're made.

1. If you haven't done so already, please reach out to MarCom to request log in credentials for the blog.  
2. Review the orientation documents.
3. Write a blog post and submit it to MarCom for review. MarCom will give feedback and let you know when you're clear to start scheduling posts.
