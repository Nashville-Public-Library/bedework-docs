# Podcast Statistics

Statistics are pulled monthly for any podcaster that requests regular updates.

Statistics are saved in a Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zLBTMUyBbnCFU1A8AbuNbVxxV2rpMtuHvQK3Nap4TmA/edit?usp=sharing

## Google Analytics

### Statistics We Can Provide

* Pageviews on the overall podcasts landing page
* Pageviews on each podcast series landing page
* Pageviews on individual podcast episode pages
* Count of people who came from a podcast referral lnik by using a campaign-tagged URL (as long as the URL is tagged)

### Statistics We Cannot Provide (But We're Working On It)

* Clicks on the audio player button on podcast episode pages (did people stream from NPL site?)
* Length of Listening / Engagement with Audio Player (how long did people listen to the audio on the NPL site?)
* Clicks on Podcast Subscribe / RSS Links (did people leave NPL to subscribe?)
* Number of downloads (how many times did someone download the mp3?)
