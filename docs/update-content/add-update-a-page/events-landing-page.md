# Events Landing Page

## Overview

Most content on the events landing page is controlled by checking and unchecking boxes in individual event pages.

- Seasonal / Ongoing: If you want an event to display in one of these lists, edit a specific event page and select either the Seasonal or Ongoing checkbox. This is optional. Events do not have to be listed in either place.
- Popular and/or Happening: If you want content to appear in the Popular or Happening sections, edit a specific event page and select Popular and/or Seasonal. Optional. Content can appear in one, both, or neither place.

There are two exceptions:

1. Event Jump Menus: Must be updated in the admin area. Notes below.
2. Unbound block: Must be updated by editing the Events landing page. Notes below.
