# Service Page

## Overview

Use the Service Content Type for pages that describe services or programs offered by the library that are not primarily event series.  

## Add Content with Components

Hero: Top part of the page. Banner is the background image. Inset image is a spot for an optional logo. Hashtag is for any hashtag link we want to advertise.

Page Components: Content area of the page. Components allow you to add the following types of content: text, text+image, blog swim, calendar widget, catalog widget, database swim, and more.

Sponsors: Added with the sponsor component. Sponsors are first added to Drupal as taxonomy terms. Once the sponsor is added to the taxonomy, it is available for the content creator to use in the sponsor paragraph.

- Featured Sponsors: Major donors who should be listed above all other sponsors with a larger logo image.
- Sponsors: Donors who can be listed together with equal-size logos.
- Sponsors by Name Only: Lists sponsors by name and does not show a logo.
