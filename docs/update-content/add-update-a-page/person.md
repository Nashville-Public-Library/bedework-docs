# Person (Author Bio and Contact Info)

There are two things called “person/people” on NPL’s D8 site.

- People (admin nav bar): Drupal users added to the site and given site permissions.
- Person (content): Content that has info and images for a specific person at NPL. Used for blog author block, directory listings, and contact information throughout the site.

This documentation refers to the Person Content (not the user).

- The person content type supplies information to the author bio and contact info blocks.
- Every blog post ends with an author block that displays a photo and a brief bio. The author bio is an excellent spot to cross-promote a library service or regular program.
- Many pages throughout the site, including the directory, have contact information, which can include a headshot.

You must contact Shared Systems to add /update the bio to the end of your blog posts, or to add / update contact information on the website.

## Add Bio and Contact Info to Drupal

1. Create Your Author Photo
      1. Recommended Tools
         1. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) (online editor)
         1. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/) (online editor)
         1. [Pixlr X](https://pixlr.com/x/) (online editor)
         1. [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) (download required)
      1. Guidelines
         1. Dimensions: Image must be 85 x 85 pixels.
         1. Headshot: If you opt to use a headshot, select an image suitable for representing the library. Your headshot does not have to be a photograph. You may also use a cartoon / drawing of your face / head.
         1. Other icon: If you would like to use an image other than your face / head, please create your image and run it by the web team. We’re not opposed to cats, dogs, parrots, marmots, inanimate objects, or other favorite images, but we don’t want to get too silly.

1. Write Author Bio and Display Name
      1. Recommended Tools
         1. Notepad (because it doesn’t add weird MS Word coding in the background)
         1. Atom (another text editor that doesn't add markup in the background)
      1. Guidelines
         1. Display name: Use only your first name or your first and last name. Choose whichever is most comfortable for you.
         1. Bios should be written in third person.
         1. Length: Bios need to be 2-3 lines of text. Write your bio in Word so you can adjust to get the right character count. This was the recommendation from our designer and it is where the character count limits come from.
            1. Min characters with spaces: 202
            1. Max characters with spaces: 296

1. Send info to Shared Systems (Kyle Cook and Jenny Ellis). Shared Systems must upload the content to the website.

## Bio Formula

1st sentence - Introduce yourself and tell readers what you do for the library.

2nd sentence - Tell readers what you’re passionate about or about your subject area of expertise. (optional)

3rd sentence - End with a link to a service or regular program, if applicable. You might also link to your favorite service provided by NPL.

Examples:

- Emily Green-Cain is part of our Bringing Books to Life outreach program. She teaches literacy skills to parents. Learn more about Bringing Books to Life.
- Amanda is a talking head on the Popmatic Podcast. She also runs the Interlibrary Loan office, so if Nashville Public Library doesn't have it, maybe she can find it.
