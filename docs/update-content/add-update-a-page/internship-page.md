# Internship Page and Internship Posts

## Overview

The NPL website has an internship landing page and individual internship posts.

- The internship page (/support/internships) lists all active internship postings.
- Each internship post has a toggle to denote if it is active (currently accepting applications).
- Internship posts are indexed in search engines.
- Once an internship is published, we do not unpublish it. Unpubilshing an internship post would lead users to a missing page and they'd get a 404 error.

1. Fill Out the Form

      1. Is this listing active: Indicate if this listing is active and accepting applications.
         1. Yes = If the listing is active it will display on the Internships page.
         1. No = If the listing is NOT active, it will not display on the internships page, but it will still be discoverable by URL, site search, and Internet search.

      1. Internship Closed Message: If the internship is not active, you must write a note in this field. See info on marking an internship closed for more details.

      1. Internship Title: Type the title of the internship. Keep titles brief. The title will display in the URL, so keep it to less than 5 words, if possible.

      1. Internship Dates: List when the internship takes place, like this: Summer 2017, Fall 2017 or Winter 2018.

      1. Project Description: Enter the project description. If pasting from Word, use the Paste from Word button.

      1. Qualifications: Enter the qualifications for the posting. If pasting from Word, use the Paste from Word button.

      1. Position Type: Enter the position type information. If pasting from Word, use the Paste from Word button.

      1. Link: Pre-populated.
         1. The link field is pre-populated with the Volgistics link (https://www.volgistics.com/ex/portal.dll/ap?AP=1009543001). If you need to use a different link, you can delete the Volgistics link and paste in a different URL.
         1. The link text field is pre-populated with the word “Apply.”

1. Create a URL Alias (optional): The URL for your Internships posting is automatically generated. ONLY USE THIS SECTION IF YOU MUST CREATE A SHORTER URL. Alternately, you can shorten the Internship Title and the auto-generated URL will be shorter.

      1. Click the URL Alias box on the right side of the page.

      1. Uncheck the box next to Generate automatic URL alias.

      1. Type in a URL alias in the text box, according to the rules listed below the picture.

         1. All internship opportunity URLs should start with the words “support/internships” then list the position title. For example: support/internships/family-literacy
         1. Use only lowercase letters.
         1. Separate words with a dash, like “contemporary-collections”.
         1. Never add a date to the URL alias.
         1. If the title is really long, pull out a few keywords from the title for the URL. Examples:
            1. internships/contemporary-collections
            1. internships/archives-century-iii-records
            1. internships/communications-copywriter

1. Save: Clicking Save does NOT publish the internship listing to the Internships page. All content is unpublished by default. You must do a second step to publish content.

## Mark an Internship Not Active / Remove a Posting from the Internships Page

Internships stay published, even when they are not active. This keeps us from having broken links in search engine results. To remove an internship from the Internships page, you must set it to inactive. You must also add an "internship closed message" that will display on the internship post page when it is found in search results.

1. Log in to the web site at https://library.nashville.org/user with your username and password.

1. In the menu bar, select Content.

1. In the filter options, select Content Type > Internship Opportunity. Then click Filter.

1. Look for the internship listing you want to update. Click Edit.

1. Set “Is this listing active?” to NO.

1. In the "internship closed message" field, type a message to make clear that the internship is not open for applicaitons. For example: "The [internship name] internship is not active. We are not accepting applications at this time.”

1. Save your changes. Your listing will disappear from the Internships page. Anyone who finds the listing on a search engine will see the message noting that the listing is not active.
