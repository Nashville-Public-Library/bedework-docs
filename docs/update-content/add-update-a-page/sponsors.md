# Sponsors

Sponsors are managed in the Sponsor Taxonomy. All sponsors across the site display the image and content from the taxonomy term.

## Sponsor Image

Requirements:

- Upload any size image (a new correctly-sized image will be created automatically where sponsor images display).
- Use images with a transparent background.
- Remove any whitespace around the image (spacing is added for you later). If you cannot use a transparent background, keep an equal amount of whitespace around the sponsor logo.

Image Styles:

- Featured Sponsor: Larger images. Always appear at the top of the sponsor list.
- Sponsor: Smaller images
- Name Only: Displays the name of the sponsor, for cases when we do not have a logo or only wish to display names.

## Add a Sponsor

1. Go to Structure > Taxonomy

1. Next to Sponsors, select List Terms.

1. Check to see if your sponsor is already in Drupal.

1. If your sponsor is NOT already in Drupal, click Add Term.
      1. Name: Enter the sponsor name.
      1. Sponsor Name: Enter the name again. I can’t remember why we added this second name field. Maybe we’ll delete it one day.
      1. Sponsor URL: Add the URL for the sponsor website.
      1. Sponsor Logo: Upload a transparent, high-res logo.

1. Save.

## Edit Sponsor Info / Image

If you need to replace a sponsor logo, update a name, or add a URL, update the taxonomy term. Updating the term will cause all instances of that sponsor on the site to be updated as well.
