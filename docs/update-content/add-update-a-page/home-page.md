# Home Page

## Overview

The homepage is made with the Landing Page content type. It uses the Promo, Catalog Widget, and Calendar Widget components to display content. Other components are available on the homepage, but shouldn’t be used at this time.

When you edit the homepage, you can see how content is divided into components. The promo and catalog widget rows are circled below.

Click **edit** next to one of the rows to see all of your editing options for that row.
- Promos: Edit or remove the promo content already present on the page. Add a new custom block (that’s the inline entity form). Or add an existing custom block already saved in the block library.
- Catalog Widgets: Swap out catalog widgets by updating the title and the widget ID. No need to delete the component.

## Home Promos

### Guidelines

- Always make a promo in English, even if we’re making it for the Spanish or Arabic landing page.
- Link to Bedework: Use bit.ly to create links for individual events in the Bedework Events Calendar. Bedework links do not work natively in Drupal.
- Link to Databases: Use the link to the database landing page on Drupal, not the database. Some database links do not work natively in Drupal.
- Images: Avoid call to action or title text in your image. If you do use text, use it sparingly. Text as image, like the VOTE graphic, is fine b/c text is part of the artwork.

There is one List Widget that takes these 5 individual widgets and makes a tabbed widget for the Drupal Home page:
