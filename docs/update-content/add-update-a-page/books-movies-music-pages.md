## Updating Catalog Spotlights  

The catalog spotlights on each BMM page are managed by Shared Systems.

### Ask for Feedback on BMM Catalog Spotlights / Topics

Shared Systems should periodically check with the Adult, Teen, and Childrenâ€™s committees to get help updating content.

1. Post a message in the Adult, Teen, and/or Children's Team on MS Teams.
1. Ask them to review the spotlights / topics on the appropriate BMM page. What should we add, update, remove?
1. Give feedback on their notes:
      1. If the committee wants to update one of the existing subject lists (Caldecott, Newbery, Concepts, etc.), let staff know they can update the list in the catalog. Changes to the catalog list will be reflected on the website automatically.
      1. If the committee wants to display new spotlights / topics, ask staff to create a list or give us a search. Shared Systems staff should make a Trello card with the changes and update the website.

### Update an Existing Catalog Spotlight in Drupal

If the committee wants to add more lists (more than the 8 already there), contact Shared Systems.
