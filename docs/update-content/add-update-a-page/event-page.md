# Event Page

## Overview

Use the Event Content Type for any event series, whether the information is in Drupal, Bedework, or Wordpress. This allows the content to be findable in site search no matter where the content lives. It also drives the Events landing page.

## Two Event Types: Internal or External

There are two ways to use the event content type: create an Internal Event or an External event.

- Use the External option for an event where the content lives outside of Drupal and we’re linking out to it. The event page allows the event to show up in search results. If External is selected, the user will be redirected to the URL defined in the External Link section.
- Use the Internal option for an event where the content lives on Drupal. In this instance you’ll leave the External Link fields blank.

## Add Content with Components

Hero: Top part of the page. Banner is the background image. Inset image is a spot for an optional logo. Hashtag is for any hashtag link we want to advertise.

Components: Content area of the page. Components allow you to add the following types of content: text, catalog widget, iFrame widget, Bedework widget, blog swim, database swim.

Sponsors: Added with the sponsor component. Sponsors are first added to Drupal as taxonomy terms. Once the sponsor is added to the taxonomy, it is available for the content creator to use in the sponsor paragraph.

- Featured Sponsors: Major donors who should be listed above all other sponsors with a larger logo image.
- Sponsors: Donors who can be listed together with equal-size logos.
- Sponsors by Name Only: Lists sponsors by name and does not show a logo.
