# Closing a Branch for a Day (Unplanned / Emergency Closure)

Use this guide to update NPL website properties when a branch closes on the spur of the moment (HVAC out, plumbing not working, etc.).

## Library Website  

MarCom will add an alert to the library website. Shared Systems doesn't need to make any updates to the website for a one-day closure.

## LibCal  

The LibCal procedures below are taken from Lane and Darrow's "Full Closure Plan" document.

### Meeting Rooms
Branch Managers will cancel meeting room bookings.  

### Appointments (Book a Librarian)
Each staff person offering appointments will cancel any appointments they have scheduled for the day.  

### Events (NECAT Only)
Branch managers or branch staff will cancel any events listed in LibCal. If patrons are registered for an event, staff will send a cancelation email.

## Bedework
See instructions for [Cancel or Reschedule](https://nashville-public-library.github.io/bedework-guide/docs/admin/cancel/)
## Google, Bing, Yelp
Do not update Google, Bing, or Yelp, in this case.
