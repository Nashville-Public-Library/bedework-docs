# How to Add Content

The first step in creating content is choosing a content type. After you select a content type, you'll fill out the content entry form. Most forms will require that you add content with components. Some forms (database, branch) will have specific fields that apply only to that type of content.

## Add Content with Components

After you've created a new page from a content type (basic page, service, etc.), you'll see the content entry form. Follow the steps to add content to the page. Refer to the [Components documentation](/update-content/add-content-with-components/overview/) for step-by-step instructions using the components.     

   1. In the content entry form, fill out any required fields.  
   1. To add additional content, look for a "Component" drop down. Some content entry forms will have two component sections, one for main content and one for a right sidebar.
