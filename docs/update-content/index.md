# Updating Content

## Where Website Content Lives

Websites and supporting pages/applications are created on several different platforms:  

- Drupal: Library website and Limitless Libraries website.  
- WordPress: NECAT Network website.  
- Bucket: Assets server at ITS hosts custom HTML sites, like Salon, and web assets (audio, video, finding aids, etc.).  
- Google: Seed Exchange borrowing form.  
- Beanstack: Reading programs.  

## Updating the NPL Website

Library website content is created with a combination of content types and components. Adding content to the website requires you to choose two things, a content type and components.

- Content Types create Pages: Special content entry forms that create specific types of pages (event, service, blog post, etc.).
-  Components: Building blocks that you use to add specific types of content. Stack the blocks together to add content to a page. Each content type has a field for components. You can add multiple components to a page.

### Step 1: Select a Content Type

Most website contributors will be creating blog or podcast content, so they'll pick Blog or Podcast. After you select a content type, you'll fill out the content entry form. Most forms will require that you add content with components. Some forms (database, branch, podcast) will have additional, specific fields that apply only to that type of content.

This is an overview. Refer to the [Pages documentation](/update-content/add-update-a-page/) for details on each content type.  

1. Log in to the [library website](https://library.nashville.org).  
1. Click "Content" in the admin menu.  
1. Click the "Add Content" button.  
1. Select from the list of content types.  
      1. Most users will only be able to add a Blog or Podcast entry.   
      1. Admin users or Editors will be able to see additional content types.

### Step 2: Add Content with Components

After you've created a new page from a content type (blog post, podcast, etc.), you'll see the content entry form. Follow the steps to add content to the page. Refer to the [Components documentation](/update-content/add-content-with-components/) for step-by-step instructions using the components.     

1. In the content entry form, fill out any required fields.  
1. To add additional content, look for a "Component" drop down. Some content entry forms will have two component sections, one for main content and one for a right sidebar.

1. Click on a component to add it to your post.  
1. After you save your component, theyâ€™ll show in a list.  
      1. Use the plus sign to reorder content.  
      1. Use the three dots to open a menu so you can remove a component.  

## Updating the Limitless Website  

The Limitless Libraries website uses some of the same components as the NPL website (though there are not as many options).

## Other Content Updates

Certain content on the NPL and Limitless websites are handled in a very specific way.

- [Special Content](/update-content/special-content-updates/): Items like Alerts, Board Agendas, Bucket sites, etc.

- [Closing a Branch](/update-content/closing-a-branch/): Step-by-step instructions on how to close a branch for a day, week, or extended period of time.

- [Page Details](/update-content/add-update-a-page/):Detailed information on how specific pages on the NPL site are made.
