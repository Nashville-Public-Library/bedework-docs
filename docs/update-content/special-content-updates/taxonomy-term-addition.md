# Configure New Taxonomy Terms

Database age and term pages are visible to users and must have a page title. In order for database term and database age taxonomy term pages to display a title, we have to do some configuration work.

When adding a new term to the database age or database topic taxonomies, we have to configure settings that will enable the term page to display correctly.

1. Go to the relevant taxonomy: Structure > Taxonomies > Database Age / Database Topic
1. Add your new term.
1. On the term page, locate the taxonomy views integrator settings box.

1. Check the box and a new set of options will appear.

   Under “with this view display” select Databases Term Pages.
   ![Local Settings](/img/term-page-update-4.jpg)
1. Save the taxonomy term.
1. View the term page and verify that the database cards are displaying in A-Z order by database title.
