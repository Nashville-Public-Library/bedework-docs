# Sponsors
Sponsors are added as taxonomy terms so that images, links, and text are updated in one place.

- Featured Sponsors: Major donors who should be listed above all other sponsors with a larger logo image.
- Sponsors: Donors who can be listed together with equal-size logos.
- Sponsors by Name Only: Lists sponsors by name and does not show a logo.

## Add a New Sponsor to the Sponsor Taxonomy

You must be a site admin to add items to any taxonomy.

1. Go to Structure > Taxonomy > Sponsor
1. Click Edit.
1. Click Add Term.
   1. Fill out the form.  

      1. Name: Type sponsor name that is visible only to site admins.  
      1. Sponsor Name: Type sponsor name that will display when we show “sponsors by name only” on a page.  
      1. Sponsor URL: Enter the URL for the sponsor website.

## Add Sponsors to a Page

Sponsors are added using a component. On most pages, the sponsor is pulled out into its own tab.

1. Select the Sponsors tab.
