# Text

## Text Toolbar

The text component, and any block where you add long-form text, will have a toolbar at the top of the box where you type. Most icons will look similar to what you find in Word or Google Docs, but some are unique.

### Format Text as a Heading

Headings give structure to a page and help humans and search engines scan a page. Choose the correct heading to define the structure. Don’t choose a heading because you like the color or font size. For more information on headings, see the [Writing for the Web](https://google.com) section of this guide.

Add a heading:
1. Highlight the text that will serve as a heading.
