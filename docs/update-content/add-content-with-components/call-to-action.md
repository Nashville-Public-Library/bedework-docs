# Call to Action

Use the Call to Action component to place a callout on your page with a call to action button, image, and text. This is usually placed at the top of a page, but can be dragged under other content, if needed.

1. Fill out the form.
      1. CTA Title: Add the Call to Action message to be featured as the headline of the space.
      1. Image: Add an image. The image should NOT have call to action text. Youâ€™ll use the text and button fields for messaging.

      1. Primary Link: Enter the URL you want users to go to.
      1. Secondary Link: If you have a secondary option, you can add that secondary link here. This is optional.
