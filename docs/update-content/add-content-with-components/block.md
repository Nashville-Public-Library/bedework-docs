# Block (Admin Only)

The block component is used by site admins to make views available to the block paragraph type, to add Components JS blocks, or to add other custom blocks to pages on the site.

## Make a Custom Block Available to the Block Paragraph

Before you can add a custom block to content, it has to be made available to the Block paragraph type (component).
**Important! You must do this step in your local development environment, export code, commit, and deploy to live.**

1. Create your custom block in views, Components JS, or elsewhere in Drupal.  

1. Go to Structure > Paragraph Types > Block > Manage Fields
