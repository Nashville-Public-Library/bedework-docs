# Blog Swim

The Blog Swim component is used to add a topic-specific list of blog posts to a page. For example, we might add a list of blog posts tagged “Be Well at NPL” to the Be Well at NPL webpage.

      1. Related Blog Taxonomy: Select the blog tag that will be used to pull in content. The blog swim will only show blog posts tagged with the selected term.

1. Save.

1. Review your blog swim to make sure that the title is correct, the links work, and that the expected content is displaying.
