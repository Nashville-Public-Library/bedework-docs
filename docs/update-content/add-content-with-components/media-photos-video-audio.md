# Media (Images, Videos, Audio)

Use the media component to add images, videos, and audio files to your page as a stand-alone element.

If you upload an image to the image library or if you add a remote image via URL, you must have permission to share the image on our website. [Get tips on finding images](/blog-orientation/images/#find-an-image-for-a-post).

Some media functionality is only available in the text component. See: [Images with Caption](/update-content/add-content-with-components/text/#add-an-image-with-a-caption) and [Linked Images](/update-content/add-content-with-components/text/#create-a-linked-image)
