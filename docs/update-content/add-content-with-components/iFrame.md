# iFrame

Use when you need to add a widget from a third-party source (JotForm, MyEmma, etc.). One exception is Flickr -- Flickr slideshows are not added using the iFrame component, even though it is an iFrame embed.

1. Add an iFrame widget component.

1. Leave Display Mode set to default.

1. Type the same title in both the Title and iFrame Title fields.

1. Paste in the iFrame URL. Only paste the URL. Do not paste any script tags or quotation marks.

1. Set the iFrame Width and Height.
