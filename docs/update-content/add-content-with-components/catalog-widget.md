## Note about lists in Aspen

Lists in Aspen have three options:

- Private: Can be seen only by the user that created it within their My Account page.
- Public: Can be shared via URL but otherwise will be same as Private; e.g., https://catalog.library.nashville.org/MyAccount/MyList/63302
- Show in Search Results: This option is only available if the list is marked 'Public' and the user has an elevated permissions.  

'Show in search results' lists, aka searchable lists, will appear in the scoped collection 'Lists':

- They are what you search when you choose 'in Lists.' Searchable lists will also appear in the Explore More widget.
- Finally, searchable lists will appear in the 'Appears on list' field of a record:
