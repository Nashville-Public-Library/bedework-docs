# Move a Domain to ITS

1. Email ITS with the following info and make sure weâ€™re good to get started.

   1. Current DNS Configuration. If you cannot log in to the domain registrar, ask the person who CAN log in what the configuration is.
1. Get the authorization code in the domain registrar admin panel. If you cannot log in to the registrar, ask the person who CAN log in to start a transfer and send you the authorization code.
1. Email Metro ITS:
   1. Send a message that explains what we need. Example below:  
   ```
   The Metro Archives division of Nashville Public Library purchased a domain name for the Archives site. The domain is currently managed through Westhost. We'd like to move the domain management to ITS so that ITS can manage renewal, etc.
   ```
   1. Send authorization code to ITS.
