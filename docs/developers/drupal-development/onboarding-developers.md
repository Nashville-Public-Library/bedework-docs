# Onboarding Developers in Pantheon

## Support

Pantheon: When opening support requests, make sure to do so from the organization page and not your user or site page. This way you get prioritized with the Gold support.

## Adding New Devs to Drupal Projects

1. Log in to Pantheon dashboard.
1. Invite users to the organization so they can have development control from an org standpoint.
