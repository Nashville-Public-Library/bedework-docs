# Overview

Podcasts are regularly occurring, episodic audio programs that have been vetted and approved for distribution in iTunes, Stitcher, and other podcasting sites.

## Responsibilities

At NPL, podcasting production, publishing, and promotion responsibilities are shared across departments:
- Systemwide Programming Subcommittee: Review and approve pitches for new podcasts.
- Marketing and Communications: Branding and marketing.
- Production Services: Recording, editing, audio production, and audio file tagging.
- Shared Systems: Podcast guidelines and process, scheduling, staff training, web implementation.

## About the Guide

This guide covers three different processes:
- Creating a new-to-NPL podcast series (including publishing new XML feed).
- Creating an episode for an existing podcast series.
- Pulling statistics for podcasts.
