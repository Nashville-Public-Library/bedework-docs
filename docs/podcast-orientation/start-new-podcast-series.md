# Start a New Podcast Series

## Get Approval for a New Podcast Series

The podcaster is responsible for attaining manager approval and submitting an application.

1. Podcaster: Get approval to record regular podcasts from your manager. Podcasting takes a lot of time. Make sure your manager understands the time commitment.
1. Podcaster: Submit an application and audition tape.
      1. Fill out the [New Podcast Application](https://form.jotform.com/NashvillePublicLibrary/new-podcast-application) form.
      1. Submit an audition tape with the application form.

The 5-person Systemwide Programming Subcommittee will review the podcast proposal to see if it aligns with NPL’s mission goals.

1. Instructions for podcast applicant:
      1. Please give the Systemwide Programming Subcommittee 4 weeks to review your application and audition tape and get back to you. If you have questions about the status of your application, you can email [kate.collingwood@nashville.gov](mailto:kate.collingwood@nashville.gov).
      1. If your application is approved, the Task Force will reach out about setting up a launch meeting.
      1. If your application is denied, the Systemwide Programming Subcommittee will reach out with details on why your pitch was not approved with tips on what you can do next.

1. Criteria for Submission Review for Subcommittee:
      1. Capacity of the staff who have to produce and do work to set up and promote the podcast. Current staff workloads allow for adding a maximum of one podcast per month.
      1. Are there other podcasts at NPL or out in the world on the same subject (saturation)?
      1. Is there a big need in the community for this information?
      1. Does the topic relate to NPL’s collection or services?

   1. In the email, share basic information about the new podcast.
   1. Ask everyone for available dates/times for a kickoff meeting.
   1. Schedule kickoff meeting with all staff who will be involved in launching the podcast.
