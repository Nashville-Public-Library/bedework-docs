# Move a Domain to ITS

1. Email ITS with the following info and make sure weâ€™re good to get started.
      1. What is the domain name?
      1. What is the current DNS configuration? If you cannot log in to the domain registrar, ask the person who CAN log in what the configuration is.

1. Get the authorization code in the domain registrar admin panel. If you cannot log in to the registrar, ask the person who CAN log in to start a transfer and send you the authorization code.

1. Email Metro ITS: Send a message that explains what we need. Include the authorization code. Example email:  
```
The Metro Archives division of Nashville Public Library purchased a
domain name for the Archives site. The domain is currently managed
through Westhost. We'd like to move the domain management to ITS so
that ITS can manage renewal, etc. The access code is [access code].
Can you help?
```

1. After ITS verifies that the move is complete, test the domain to make sure it still works.
      1. If the domain isn't sending users to the right place, email ITS.
      1. If the domain is sending users to the right place, you're done.
