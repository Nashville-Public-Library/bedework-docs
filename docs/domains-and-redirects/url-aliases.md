# URL Aliases

A URL alias creates a friendly, human-readable URL for a piece of content.

On the NPL website, most URL Aliases are automatic. The URL is determined by a pattern set up in PathAuto and the alias is created automatically when you save a page.

URL Aliases created under the following circumstances:
- Basic Page: You must create custom URL Aliases for basic pages.
- Landing Page: You must create custom URL Aliases for landing pages.
- Long Title: When page titles MUST BE very long (should be a rare case), edit the alias to make the URL shorter.

Guideliens:
- Do not change an automatically generated alias.
- You should only have ONE URL Alias per node. This is the canonical URL.
- If you change the title of a page, it changes the URL Alias. So, if you change the title of a page (and the URL Alias changes) you must create a URL Redirect for the original URL.
- Beneficial so you can track how many people come to this page b/c you can track the canonical URL.
