# Headings

Headings give structure to a page and help humans and search engines scan a page.
- DO: Choose the correct heading to define the structure.
- DO NOT: Choose a heading because you like the color or font size.

Headings:
- Heading 1: Drupal uses Heading 1 for the title of a page, so you won’t see that as an option in the text editor.
- Heading 2: Use for the major sections of a page.
- Heading 3: Use for subsections under a Heading 2.
- Heading 4: Use for subsections under a Heading 3. You likely will not use Heading 4 very often.

For consistency, always use “title case” for headings.
- Do: Unicorn and Cat Have a Birthday Party
- Don’t: Unicorn and cat have a birthday party

Keep headings brief. Don’t use an entire sentence for a heading.
