# Writing for the Web

People read blog posts differently than they read a printed book. Studies show that online readers scan for information. Writing that fits this reading style will help users more easily digest information and locate calls to action.

## Headings

Headings give structure to a page and help humans and search engines scan a page.

- DO: Choose the correct heading to define the structure.
- DO NOT: Choose a heading because you like the color or font size.

Headings:

- Heading 1: Drupal uses Heading 1 for the title of a page, so you won’t see that as an option in the text editor.
- Heading 2: Use for the major sections of a page.
- Heading 3: Use for subsections under a Heading 2.
- Heading 4: Use for subsections under a Heading 3. You likely will not use Heading 4 very often.

For consistency, always use “title case” for headings.

- Do: Unicorn and Cat Have a Birthday Party
- Don’t: Unicorn and cat have a birthday party

Keep headings brief. Don’t use an entire sentence for a heading.

## Page Text

- Single space between sentences.
- Keep paragraphs short.
- Use bulleted/numbered lists when appropriate to make info scan-able.

## Linked Text

Make linked text meaningful. Don’t use “click here” or “more info” because people using a screen reader will not be able to determine where the link will go. Instead use “Sign up for Mango now” or “Request a copy of Men in Black” so that the linked text clearly identifies what the link will take you.

## Calls to Action

Each blog post should have a call to action -- something we want readers to do.

- Link recommended items owned by NPL to a grouped record in the catalog.
- Link to outside content when it is interesting and enriching, but avoid too many external links.

## Book Review Tips

- Give a clue as to the genre of the book – mystery, thriller, literary novel, etc.
- Short synopsis – don’t give away the plot, just give enough to tantalize folks.
- Discuss whether it’s well-written and why.
- What you liked specifically about the book.
- Why would someone else want to read it?
- What else the author has written? What other titles are similar, maybe by other authors? List these titles in You Might Also Like.
